# Time Series Forcasting of Flow Rate in Gas Wells in order to prevent Liquid Loading

This program performs a multivariate (2 variable - Flow Rate and Casing Pressure) 
time series forcasting using LSTM model. The LSTM model learns the dependncy
of two variables in the sequence and makes future predictions
